Several approaches can mitigate this issue:

1. **Verify Rule Caching:** Ensure the Firebase emulators are properly configured and that the rules are correctly uploaded and applied.  Restarting the emulators can resolve caching problems.  If the problem occurs in production, ensure rules are deployed correctly.

2. **Check Rule Timing:** Sometimes, the timing of write operations matters. Ensure that data needed for authorization is available *before* attempting a write. For example, if you use the auth token of the current user to establish authorization, make sure it is correctly available and verified before executing write operations.

3. **Rule Syntax:** Double check the syntax of your security rules in `database.rules.json`. A seemingly small syntax error can cause unexpected behavior, potentially resulting in `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors. Make sure the rules are valid JSON and follow the Firebase Realtime Database rule structure.

4. **Simplify Rules:** If rules are complex, start by simplifying them to isolate possible issues. Once you have a working (albeit simpler) set of rules, start adding back the complexity gradually.

5. **Debugging:** Utilize Firebase's debugging tools for Realtime Database rules to analyze rule evaluations in real-time. This will help pinpoint where the permission problem is occurring.

Example code (bug.js):

```javascript
// Code to demonstrate problem
// ...

firebase.database().ref('/myData').set({someData:'someValue'})
.catch(error => {
  console.error('Error writing to database:', error);
});
```

Example code (bugSolution.js):

```javascript
// Improved code implementing the solutions described above
// ...
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(user => {
  if (user) {
    // User is signed in.
    // Get the current user's uid to use in security rules.    
    const uid = user.uid;
    //Perform database operation.
  } else {
    // No user is signed in.
    // Handle authentication as needed.
  }
});
```
