This repository demonstrates a common yet frustrating issue with Firebase's Realtime Database: intermittent `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors despite apparently correct security rules. The `bug.js` file reproduces the problem, while `bugSolution.js` offers potential solutions and workarounds.  The issue is likely related to caching or timing inconsistencies between rule changes and client requests. This repo provides insights into troubleshooting and mitigating such errors.
